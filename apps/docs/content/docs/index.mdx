  PolicyFlow is an MVP. Core features are functional. Production hardening, SSO, and directory import are on the roadmap.

**PolicyFlow** is a self-hosted, open-source policy management system that lets you:

- **Distribute policies** to your team with versioning and a clear approval workflow
- **Track acknowledgements** — know exactly who has read and signed each policy version
- **Authenticate without passwords** — staff log in via magic links sent to their work email
- **Own your data** — everything runs on your infrastructure, in a single Go binary

## Why PolicyFlow?

Most policy management tools are either expensive SaaS platforms or unwieldy compliance suites. PolicyFlow is designed to be:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Self-hosted** | Run on any Linux box, VM, or container |
| **Zero-ops** | SQLite — no Postgres, Redis, or external services needed |
| **Single binary** | Frontend + backend ships as one 17MB executable |
| **Auditable** | Each acknowledgement has a SHA-256 signature hash |
| **Extensible** | Ready for SSO, LDAP, and employee directory integration |

## Core Concepts

### Policy Lifecycle

```
Draft → Review → Published → Archived
```

Only `Published` policies are visible to staff. Admins control all state transitions.

### Versioning

Each policy update creates a new version (e.g. `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`). Staff must re-acknowledge when a new version is published.

### Acknowledgements

Each acknowledgement stores:
- `user_id` + `policy_version_id` + `timestamp`
- `signature_hash` = SHA-256 of the above — lightweight audit trail

### Magic-Link Auth

No passwords. Users click a link emailed to their work address. Links expire in 24 hours; sessions last 7 days.

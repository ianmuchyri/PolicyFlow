# Quickstart



import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import { Steps, Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* Go 1.25+
* Node.js 22+ and pnpm 10+
* Git

***

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Clone the repository [#clone-the-repository]

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourorg/policyflow
    cd policyflow
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Build [#build]

    The `make build` command installs frontend deps, runs `next build`, then compiles the Go binary with the static files embedded:

    ```bash
    make build
    # → build/policyflow  (~17MB single binary)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Run [#run]

    ```bash
    ./build/policyflow
    # WARNING: JWT_SECRET not set — using insecure default (development only)
    # Seeding database with initial data…
    #   Created admin user: admin@policyflow.local
    #   Created staff user: staff@policyflow.local
    #   Created policy: Employee Code of Conduct
    # PolicyFlow listening on :8080
    ```

    Open **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Log in [#log-in]

    No SMTP is configured in development, so login links are printed directly to the server log:

    ```
    📧 EMAIL (no SMTP configured)
    To: admin@policyflow.local
    Subject: PolicyFlow — Your login link
    Body:
      http://localhost:8080/api/magic-login?token=eyJ...
    ```

    Copy the URL and paste it in your browser to log in as admin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

***

Development Mode (hot reload) [#development-mode-hot-reload]

Run the Go backend and Next.js dev server simultaneously:

```bash
# Terminal 1
make dev-frontend    # Next.js on :3001

# Terminal 2
make dev-backend     # Go on :8080, proxies frontend to :3001
```

Any changes to `apps/app/web/` will hot-reload in the browser. Go source changes require restarting `make dev-backend`.

***

Seed Credentials [#seed-credentials]

| Role  | Email                    |
| ----- | ------------------------ |
| Admin | `admin@policyflow.local` |
| Staff | `staff@policyflow.local` |

Use the magic-link flow above for either account. The seed only runs once — if you want a fresh start, run `make db-reset`.

***

Next Steps [#next-steps]

* Add real users via the **Admin → Users** tab
* Create a policy and publish a version
* Configure SMTP so emails are actually delivered (see [Deployment](/docs/deployment))
